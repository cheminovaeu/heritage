##Cheminova Project Description

ChemiNova aims to develop an intelligent computational system that goes beyond current technologies to improve the conservation, analysis and monitoring of European Cultural Heritage assets. Using a myriad of data, we will tackle structural and chemical damages, focusing on two specific human-induced threats: climate change and civil conflicts.

Inspired by the simplicity of a childrenâ€™s game, our value relies on the conviction that we will facilitate the work of heritage professionals.  Using a single framework, they will be able to document, digitize, classify, and share information for cultural heritage conservation. Our impact lies in the fact that we will not build an ad hoc device, but a technology that is adaptable so that anyone can access it from anywhere. We will engage local communities, encouraging citizen participation in conservation practices, from providing data (citizen science) to raising awareness on the effects of climate change, natural and human hazards affecting cultural heritage.
